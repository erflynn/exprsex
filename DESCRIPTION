Version: 0.1.0
Author: E Flynn
Maintainer: E Flynn <erflynn@stanford.edu>
Description: 
    Performs sex labeling of microarray expression datasets. This package looks at 
    the ranks of genes with consistent male- and female-specific expression in order 
    label samples as male or females. This method allows for robust sex-labeling 
    across a wide range of platforms and study sex breakdowns.
